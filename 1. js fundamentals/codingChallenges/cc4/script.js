// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25”

// Test data:
// § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
// Hints:
// § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300

const billvalue = 400;
const tip =
  billvalue >= 50 && billvalue <= 300
    ? (billvalue * 15) / 100
    : (billvalue * 20) / 100;
const totalValue = billvalue + tip;
console.log(`Bill value is ${billvalue} 
Tip : ${tip}
Total Value : ${totalValue}`);
