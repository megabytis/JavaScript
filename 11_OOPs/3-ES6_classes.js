/*
so, it means, we add an method to a class's Prototype using "Prototype method",
but, writing methods iniside class diretly, also being added to class's Prototype automatically under the hood :)
=> so, finally IT'S BETTER TO METHODS DIRETLY INSIDE CLASS

Only use 'Prototype Methods' when:

    - Extending built-in objects (Array, String, etc.).
    - Dynamically adding methods at runtime (rarely needed).
*/

/*  Important points :
1. Classes are not Hoisted
    i.e. we can't use the class before the class declaration

2. Classes are also first-class citizens
    i.e. classes can be passed into functions and also can be returned from a function .

3. Classes are always being executed in STRICT MODE .
*/

/*
so, finally we got 2 ways;
(i) Constructor Function , (ii) ES6 class
we can use any one between two,
i personally love üòç ES6 classes, cuz it looks CLASSIC, GENTLEMAN Type :), SIMPLE
