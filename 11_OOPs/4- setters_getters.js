/*
both '_email' and 'email' are keys/properties of the object, but they behave very differently

1. _email (The Actual Data Storage)

    A regular property that directly stores the value.

    Convention: The _ prefix suggests it's "private" (but technically still accessible).

2. email (The Getter/Setter Property)
  - A special property that doesn't store data itself.
  - Backed by getter/setter functions:
      # When you read user.email ‚Üí Calls the get email() function.
      # When you assign user.email = "new@example.com" ‚Üí Calls the set email(value) function.
