###### Asynchronous Code in JavaScript

Asynchronous code allows your program to perform tasks without waiting for other tasks to finish.
Hence, it's is non-blocking â€“ doesn't pause execution for tasks to finish.

ðŸ§µ How it works:

    JavaScript has a single thread of execution.

    Asynchronous tasks (e.g. image loading, API calls, timers etc...) are sent to the background.

    Once complete, they return and are executed via the event loop.

ðŸ§ª Code Example (Image Loading):

```js
const img = document.querySelector(".dog");
img.src = "dog.jpg";

img.addEventListener("load", function () {
  img.classList.add("fadeIn"); // Runs after image loads
});

p.style.width = "300px";
```

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:

    addEventListener('load', ...) sets a callback for when the image finishes loading.

    This is asynchronous behavior, triggered after the image loads.

**_NOTE:_**
addEventListener alone does not make code asynchronousâ€”it's the event (e.g., image loading, API calling, timer running, DOMs etc...) thatâ€™s async.

âœ… What actually makes code asynchronous:

    Asynchronous APIs(e.g. setTimeout(), fetch(), addEventListener(), etc...) provided by the browser (or Node.js):

        These APIs handle work in the background.

        Once done, they notify JavaScript through the event loop.

        Only then do callback functions run.
