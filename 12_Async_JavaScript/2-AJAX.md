###### 🌐 AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)

🚀 What is AJAX?

    A technique in JavaScript that allows communication with remote web servers.

    It works in an asynchronous way — meaning the browser doesn't freeze or wait while data is being fetched.

    AJAX enables dynamic data fetching without reloading the whole page

🔁 How AJAX Works (Flow):

    Client (Browser) sends a request to the Web Server.

        Usually via HTTP methods like GET, POST, etc.

        Example: Fetching user data, weather info, etc.

    Web Server (API) processes the request and sends back a response.

        Typically returns data in JSON format.

    The client receives the data and can update the UI without reloading the page.
