An API is a piece of software that allows different applications to communicate with each other.

    Think of it as a waiter between your code and external services.

🧱 Types of APIs in Web Development:

        API                    Type Description
    DOM API             Interact with HTML elements via JavaScript
    Geolocation API     Get user’s physical location
    Own Class API       Custom class methods you create
    Online API          Web-based APIs (just called “API” usually)

🌍 Online API (a.k.a Web API):

    Runs on a server.

    Accepts requests for data (e.g., from your frontend).

    Sends responses back (usually in JSON).

    Commonly accessed via AJAX calls.

🛠️ We can:

    Build our own APIs (e.g., using Node.js, Express).

    Use 3rd-party APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Google Maps API, etc.).

🔄 AJAX + API → Common Combo

    AJAX was originally designed to work with XML, but now:

        ❌ XML is outdated.

        ✅ JSON is the standard format used in APIs today.

📦 Popular Use-Cases of APIs:

    🌦️ Weather data

    🌍 Country data

    ✈️ Flight info

    💱 Currency conversion

    ✉️ Email/SMS sending

    🗺️ Google Maps

    🧠 Endless possibilities...

    🧠 There’s literally an API for everything.
