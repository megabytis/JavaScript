###### SCOPING AND SCOPE IN JAVASCRIPT ########################################

#### Key Concepts
- **Scoping**: How variables are organized and accessed.
- **Lexical Scoping**: Variables are accessible based on their placement in the code.
- **Scope**: Region where a variable is declared and accessible.
   # 3 types of scope ;
      - **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function. can be accessed everywhere .
      - **Function Scope**: Variables declared inside a function, can't be accessed outside the function. 
      - **Block Scope**: Variables declared inside a block (`for`, `while`, etc...) with `let`, `const`, 
      can't be accessed outside the block
      ### but... but... but..., declared with `var` inside a block can be accessed outside the block ####

#### inside Execution Context
- **Variable Environment**: Stores variables and functions.
- **Lexical Environment**: Tracks the Scope Chain 
      i.e. holds current EC's element + an reference of it's outer Lexical Environment 
- **Scope Chain**: Links Lexical Environments to resolve variables.

#### Example
```js
const globalVar = 'I am global';

function outerFunction() {
    const outerVar = 'I am in outerFunction';
    
    function innerFunction() {
        const innerVar = 'I am in innerFunction';
        console.log(globalVar); // Accessible via Scope Chain
        console.log(outerVar);  // Accessible via Scope Chain
        console.log(innerVar);  // Accessible locally
    }

    innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```
// let's understand it :----
// in stack memory , there will be global execution context at the low end , there would be 'globalVar' variable only , above it there would be another execution context for "outerFunction", here there would be 'outerVar' variable , then above it there would be execution context for "innerFunction", here there would be 'innerVar' variable 
// then inside innerFunction , when it's said console.log(globalVar),  it first tried to find 'globalVar' in the top execution context present in stack memory as it follows LIFO rule, then not found , so go down execution context of "outerFunction" through scoping chain , nd result found , then print .

## 📚 Scope Chain vs. Call Stack

### 🧠 Code Example

const a = 'Jonas';
first();

function first() {
  const b = 'Hello!';
  second();

  function second() {
    const c = 'Hi!';
    third();
  }
}

function third() {
  const d = 'Hey!';
  console.log(d + c + b + a); // ❌ ReferenceError
}

here :------

| Scope Level  | Variables Accessible                                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global Scope | `a`, `first`, `third` , ❌ `second()`, `b`, `c`, have to call `first()`, ❌ `d`, have to call `third()` |
| `first()`    | `b`, `second` + everything from global     |
| `second()`   | `c` + everything from `first()` & global   |
| `third()`    | `d`, `a` from global, ❌ cannot access `b`, `c`|

*** ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ***
We can create multiple same named variables in multiple scopes i.e. blocks, functions etc...

e.g.
```js
const a = 90

function sample_1() {
      let a = 80;
}

const sample_2 = () => {
      var a = 70;

      if(a != 90) {
            let a = 80;
      }
} 
```
