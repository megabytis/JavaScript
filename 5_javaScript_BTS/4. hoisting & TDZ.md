###### HOISTING IN JAVASCRIPT ##########################################################

### 🔝 What is Hoisting?

JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope
before code runs. This is called "Hoisting".

Only DECLARATIONS are moved — not assignments or initializations.

---

### ✅ Function Declarations Are Fully Usable Early

Example:
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

sayHello(); // ✅ Works

Hoisted like:
sayHello();
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

✅ You can call functions before they appear in your code.

---

### ⚠️ var Variables Are Partially Hoisted

Only declaration is hoisted — value stays in place.

Example:
```js
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 10;

JS sees it like this:
var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 10;
```
⚠️ You can access `x` early, but its value is `undefined`.

---

### ❌ let & const Are Not Usable Before Declaration

They are hoisted but not accessible until declared.
This is called the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

Example:
```js
console.log(y); // ❌ Reference Error
let y = 20;

console.log(z); // ❌ Reference Error
const z = 30;
```
❌ You cannot use `let` or `const` variables before their line runs.

---

### ❌ Function Expressions Behave Like Variables

Function expressions using `var`, `let`, or `const` are NOT fully hoisted.

Example:
```js
console.log(myFunc); // undefined
const myFunc = function () {
    console.log("Hi");
};
```
📌 JS knows `myFunc` exists, but it's `undefined` until assigned.

If you try to CALL it before assignment → ❌ TypeError

### 📋 Quick Summary Table

| Type                                                  | Can Use Before Declaration? | Value Before Use         |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Function Declaration (function xyz() {})              | ✅ Yes                      | The function itself      |
| Function Expression (having const, arrow func)        | ❌ No                       | undefined                |
| var x = 10                                            | ⚠️ Yes                      | undefined                |
| let y = 20 / const z = 30                             | ❌ No                       | <uninitialized> (TDZ)    |

### 🎯 Final Takeaway

- ✅ Function declarations are fully usable from the start.
- ⚠️ `var` variables exist early but have no value yet.
- ❌ `let` and `const` are declared early but CANNOT be used until their line runs.

### Best Practice: Declare Everything at the Top 

    📌 First declare all variables and functions. Then use them.  
     

This way, you don’t have to worry about hoisting , Temporal Dead Zones, or confusing behavior. 

Example:
```js
// Step 1: Variables
let x = 10;
const y = 20;

// Step 2: Functions
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// Step 3: Logic
console.log(add(x, y));
```
🎯 This avoids hoisting problems completely!
